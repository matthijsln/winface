3. Usage notes

For information about what a X-Face is, see:
   http://www.cs.indiana.edu/ftp/faces/index.html

This program is an interface for the compface library, originally programmed
by James Ashton. Because command-line tools work rather awkward with images,
a simple graphical user interface is useful.

In order to view an X-Face, copy the part after X-Face: present in the headers
of the e-mail message or Usenet post and paste it in the edit-box in the
interface, and click "To Image". The X-Face will now be decompressed and
converted to an image.

You can save this image to disk as a .bmp file by clicking "Save...". With
"Open..." you can open a .bmp file from disk, which will be converted into an
X-Face.

Then you can paste this text into your newsreader or mailclient settings as a
custom "X-Face" header. How this is accomplished is described for Xnews and
Gravity in chapter 3.

Before copying the text to the clipboard, you may need to click the "Single
Line" or "C-Escape" buttons first - this depends on your newsreader or
mailclient (For both Gravity and Xnews you first need to click "Single Line"
but not "C-Escape"). To copy the X-Face text to the clipboard: right-click the
edit box and click "Select All". Right-click the edit box again and select
"Copy".

You might want to test the correct configuration by posting in a test newsgroup
such as alt.test or sending an e-mail to yourself to confirm the correct X-Face
header was sent along with your message.

For the best results, the .bmp image should be 48x48 black-and-white. Other
image sizes will work, but will be shrunk or stretched (by Windows) which
usually produces ugly results.

Note that if you use a bitmap with colors, WinFace won't complain, but if you
used colors and/or grayscale, the resulting image may not be what you expect.

You can use a program such as Paint Shop Pro to convert a color image to
grayscale and then to black-and-white using error diffusion dithering. I'm
planning on integrating resampling and dithering in a next version of WinFace.

3.1 Xnews
http://xnews.3dnews.net/

Go to "Special", "Setup Xnews", "Compose", "Custom Headers", enter the
text "X-Face: " with your X-Face after that, like this:

  X-Face: ,yZe&Tj9$FUgmULRq.5...
(note the space after the first colon)

Make sure you first clicked "Single Line" in WinFace to put the X-Face on a
single line. It's convenient to put a "*" before "X-Face: "; like this:

  *X-Face: ,yZe&Tj9$FUgmULRq.5...

This will make sure it is always sent by default. You can enter multiple X-Face
headers, and select the one you want when composing a message: click
"2. Custom" to enable or disable the X-Face header you want (only for the post
you are writing). You can also enter something yourself, click "3. Manual
headers".

Xnews now automatically shows a X-Face if a post has one!

3.2 Microplanet Gravity
See Tom's Gravity Pages for info:
  http://lightning.prohosting.com/~tbates/gravity/
  http://gravity.tbates.org/

You can setup a default X-Face for every group and override that default on a
per group basis. To setup the default, go to "View" -> "Global Options", and
select the "Posting tab". In the "Custom headers" edit box, first enter
"X-Face: ", and then paste the X-Face after this:

  X-Face: ,yZe&Tj9$FUgmULRq.5...
(note the space after the first colon)

Because Gravity can't handle custom headers spanning more than a single line,
you first have to put the X-Face on one line (click "Single Line"). If you want
a different X-Face in some group, right-click on the newsgroup name, pick
"Properties...", click "Overrides", and enter the X-Face in the "Override
custom headers" edit box.

If the custom header text exceeds 255 characters, like this:

X-Face: "&lQ3uWNptUxl)kx>F!d#oH'9Hr$\K&st/&|CAQJeBCxE:<@wL)6C*yBC*c22|!0Z&ix/t/QrB-1zRt?;9v5-V`lqt(e#GF`&o's8TB3m.U4y-a7%;k6dW]`NYY/HnCiC"Y6Oh)!;AFq'zb,v{V]S{*56zR9-zPKt2J[Pi"=5G'}T+Gavk8A%4)yRZzcl@r4D68sxSd"k=i..NK/~9>jeX\|0<.t`_#_!|9|ons^[VC/cZ;~TR/sGNsL`k(K%s{}
(total 264 characters)

Gravity will truncate it to 255 characters:

X-Face: "&lQ3uWNptUxl)kx>F!d#oH'9Hr$\K&st/&|CAQJeBCxE:<@wL)6C*yBC*c22|!0Z&ix/t/QrB-1zRt?;9v5-V`lqt(e#GF`&o's8TB3m.U4y-a7%;k6dW]`NYY/HnCiC"Y6Oh)!;AFq'zb,v{V]S{*56zR9-zPKt2J[Pi"=5G'}T+Gavk8A%4)yRZzcl@r4D68sxSd"k=i..NK/~9>jeX\|0<.t`_#_!|9|ons^[VC/cZ;~TR/sGNs

This will garble the X-Face, so if your X-Face happens to be longer than 247
characters you can't send it with Gravity. No workaround is known yet (apart
from using NNTP proxy software such as Hamster, which is beyond the scope of
this text).

3.3 C-Escape

The "C-Escape" button replaces the following characters:

Original      Becomes
\              \\
"              \"
(line break)   \n
%              %%

This is useful if your newsreader (slrn) or e-mailclient (Eudora) treats the
extra headers as a "C-format string". In that format, characters such as \ and
" are "special characters". To get these characters literally, escape sequences
must be used. For \ and " they are \\ and \", respectively.

If you want the header to be on a single line, there is no need to click
"Single Line" before clicking "C-Escape", provided that you didn't edit the
text manually.

Note: if, after clicking "C-Escape", you click on "To Image", the image will be
garbled, but this is logical; you'll have to reload the original image or
revert the changes manually.

If you have edited the X-Face text, you can press the C-Escape button multiple
times. This isn't very useful, though. The X-Face text will also never be
longer than 1056 characters - if the C-escaped text would be longer than that,
it is truncated.

4. Gravity X-Face display patch

Gravity was not designed display X-Faces. I've created a patch that might add
that feature. To apply the patch, copy gravity-x-face-patch.exe and WinFace.dll
to the directory you have installed Gravity in and run gravity-x-face-patch.exe.
It will check if the Gravity.exe file is a known version, create a backup of
the original, and apply the patch.

The patched Gravity.exe will require WinFace.dll to exist in the directory
Gravity.exe is in.

If you cannot find WinFace.dll, make sure you have setup Explorer to show all
files and extensions. In Explorer, go to the Tools or View menu, choose Folder
Options..., View tab, uncheck "Hide file extensions for known file types", and
check "Show all files" (if available).

Whenever a body is shown by Gravity, the patch will intercept the headers and
pass them to code in WinFace.dll which will check if a X-Face header is
present. If there is, it will show the image in a little window. Note that when
you select another article without downloading its body after an X-Face was
shown, the image shown won't belong to the article which is selected.

In some cases the first time a post is shown the window might display a wrong
X-Face. Clicking the posts header in Gravity's thread window again should
correct that problem.

You can move the window by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the
mouse cursor after clicking on the window. Click the right mouse button to
bring up a context menu with the following options:

 - Hide when no X-Face available
    When checked, the little window will not be visible when the current post
    does not have an X-Face header.
 - Double size
    Stretches the X-Face to 96x96.
 - Black color...
    Select the color to use for "black".
 - White color...
    Select the color to use for "white".
 - Copy Image
    Copies the image to the clipboard. If you're using Windows 95 or Windows 98
    and the image copied is entirely black, set the "black" color to black and
    the "white" color to white. Windows 2000 doesn't have this problem.
 - Copy X-Face text
    Copies the X-Face text to the clipboard.

    These last two options are disabled if the current post does not have an
    X-Face header.
 - Disable
    Disables the display of X-Faces. This option is not saved, so the next
    time Gravity starts the patch will be enabled. To permanently disable
    the patch, restore the backup of the unpatched Gravity.exe.

The patch saves the position of the window and some settings in
x-face-patch.ini in your Windows directory or in the registry.

Please beware that this patch is a hack. I've tested it and it works, but
there's a chance it won't work on your system -- or worse, crash it completely.

As such, there is *absolutely no guarantee* about what it will or won't do.
Even more, I probably can't help you when it crashes so I don't support it.
Please refer to the BSD license in chapter 1 above for the license and
disclaimer.

Make sure you have saved all open documents before running the patched Gravity
so you lose no data when the system crashes. This is especially true for
Windows 95, 98 and ME -- I rarely have a complete system-wide lockup on
Windows 2000 but Windows 98 is extremely unstable in that regard. Your mileage
may vary.

Should you see a message such as "Error 96: Cannot create another thread.": the
number (96 in this example) designates a line number in patchsupport.asm. The
error text comes from Windows and may not apply to what's really the problem.
